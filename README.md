# Apriori-Algorithm
## Association rule mining algorithms such as Apriori are very useful for finding simple associations between our data items.
## They are easy to implement and have high explain-ability.
## However for more advanced insights, such those used by Google or Amazon etc., more complex algorithms, such as recommender systems, are used.
## However, you can probably see that this method is a very simple way to get basic associations if that's all your use-case needs
